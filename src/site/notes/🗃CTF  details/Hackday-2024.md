# Hackday 2024 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è

> Big thanks to my team! We pulled off an extraordinaire performance because we were fantastic togethers üíñ
> We all complemented each others skill perfectly and that's our core strength in my opinion.
> The chad list:
> - [Skilo](https://skilo.sh) our CryptoBoy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
> - [Flow](https://www.root-me.org/Fllow) our Forensic expert üîç
> - [Saad](https://www.root-me.org/saad-rl) our Web king üëë

## Performance
One challenge away from **full wipe**. One first blood, almost got 3 but lost minutes away. Top 10 quite a long time but ended 12th. Almost a perfect performance, at least one to be proud of.

Rank: *12th* with *4954 points* ü§Øüéâ
	I scored *2115 points* with *13 challenges solved* ü•≥

## How to improve üìù
### Reverse
- Rust chall was really easy but it served as a good introduction to the subject. I love Rust so I should maybe pause my Python bytecode study for some quick Rust reverse study!
### General
- Go outside more often, I fall too often in rabbit holes üï≥Ô∏è
