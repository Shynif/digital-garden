# vsCTF

## Performance
Tried my best on *reverse* and *forensic* but was too sick and couldn't play day 2 😞✊

## How to improve 📝
### Reverse
- Lay out more what is happening. Try not to be shy in front of wild op codes. Tame the beast !
- Lesson learned, look deeper into sub functions !
### Forensic
- Do more of that ! It's great ✨ (kudos to the challmakers, the theme was really fun in my opinion)
