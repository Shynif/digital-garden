# Newport Blake CTF 2023 🍎🎓📏

## Performance
Aimed to flag 100% as it was a very simple CTF for highschool players. Ended up being a one man CTF as I was the only player in the team to work on it during the entire weekend (or just to work on it more than an hour 😔)

Rank: *40th* with *4751 points*
	I scored *4280 points* with *11 challenges solved* (23% of the CTF) 🥳

## How to improve 📝
### Reverse
- Ok. Time for Z3. I love coding myself the solve scripts but ... yeah ... I'm losing precious time
### General
- Confirms that I need bigger challenges in OSINT. I got the methodology, now time for more specific and challenging experiences !
- Pivot a bit more ? I got 3 challenges almost done (~95% for real) but I might have flagged more if I pivoted earlier. I'm still glad I've stuck with one as it was a great challenge and it's a quality to keep exploring. However in this context, for performance sake I should have pivoted and just read+studied the WU after.
