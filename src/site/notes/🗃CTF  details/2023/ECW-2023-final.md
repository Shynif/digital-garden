## Performance
We did great for a team of random people who talked to each others 10 minutes before the beginning of the competition 😅 Ranked ``6th`` out of 11 teams.
I tried to bring us together and asked everyone about what they were doing, if there were steps made, if they needed help or rubber ducking, ... I hope it helped us communicate a bit more than "I flagged".
Challenge-wise **I sucked**. I lost our team **3 hours** at the beginning... I'm extremely ashamed and won't make the same mistake again (I forgot the flag's last 3 characters)

## How to improve 📝
### General
- First LAN CTF and wasn't prepared enough for the fatigue that slowly raised. At the end during the pentest I was really not willing to do some stuff I would rush and have been done in minutes at the beginning.
### Web
- Need to work on much bigger challenges with less guidance. More CTF, less RootMe.
  My visibility is too narrow sometimes, I need to see wider possibilities + explore more in the unknown/invisible parts (directory traversal for instance)

## Solves
- Steg : 1
- Pentest : 1
