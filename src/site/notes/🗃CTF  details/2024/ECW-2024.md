## Performance 🏆🏅
Such a growth since [[🗃CTF  details/2023/ECW-2023-final\|last year]]. I went personally from 👶 to 🧒 (hoping to be 👨‍🦳 one day)
There was less competition due to a bad qualification phase this year compared to last year, but still.
**32th in quals** and **4th in finals** is amazing !
Since last year, I acquired some agility when tackling new challenges. I improved my speed. And I learned key topics to be able to solve some challenges. All of this combined lead to these great results that I'm deeply proud of. Yet I still hope to improve to push my limits further and beyond (and maybe we will win this CTF one day 🤩💖💪).

Rank: ***4th*** with *1400 points* for the Finals 🤯🎉
	and I scored *1429 points* during qualifications with *9 challenges solved* 🥳🤯💖

## How to improve 📝
### Web
- *The devil hides in the details*. I need to pay better attention to some details (like the PHPSESSIONID for exemple😈). Also I need to try harder: I need to trust myself and I should not surrender because I think I'm not capable of doing it.
### Crypto
- I learned it the hard way for this CTF
- I need to study cryptographic systems on paper at earlier stages of solving.
- I need to work on my crypto skills 💪🥵🔐
### General
- Grandpa making diner while I'm flagging is such a goated strat 💪👴🐐💖
- Pwn when ?
- Crypto is an amazing category that I should work on more often
