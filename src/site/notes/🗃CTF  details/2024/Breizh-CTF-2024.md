# Breizh 2024 🌊😋🌧️

> Big thanks to my team! We did great togethers 💖
> The chad list:
> - **Al-oxos**, our Web enjoyer 🤤
> - **Alex532h**, our Forensic expert 🔍
> - **p.gsd**, our Reverse connoisseur 👨‍🍳🥞
> - **NineLine**, our Pwn whisperer 🙏
> Maybe some don't have a lot of points on the leaderboard but we mostly worked 3 at a time on difficult challenges. Over 60% of our flags come from pure team effort 💪

## Performance 🏆
Good ranking quite a long time but ended 30th out of 120 teams. I did my OSINT duty but my team mates had a lot of troubles on their challenges. Not that I blame them, after I cleared the OSINT I couldn't solved anything 😭✊

Rank: *30th* with *5029 points* 🤯🎉
	full cleared the 8 OSINT challenges 🕵️‍♂️

## How to improve 📝
### OSINT
- Pretty slow, there is some work to do on my SOCINT methodology
### General
- Brain dead on other challenges that's insane. I don't know what could make me flag. Maybe some sleep and more training to manage to flag even shit-headed
- I tanked very well the sleep depravation even without sleeping the day before !!! 🤯

## Solves
didn't save the leaderboard in time :(
-  OSINT : 8, full clear
