# DaVinciCTF 2025 ü•áüî•üñºÔ∏èüßô

> Infinite thanks to my team! We did perfect togethers üíñ
> The chad list:
> - [**Drahoxx**](https://x.com/50mgDrahoxx), our Hardware and chip whisperer üó£Ô∏èüíΩüìü
> - [**K.L.M**](https://x.com/Clemhate2), our Forensic legend (and nerfed Web3 king) üïµÔ∏èüî•
> - **Th√©o, QuantumDaddy**, our Crypto Alan Turing üîê‚ö°
> Many will say I was boosted for this CTF and I won't disagree üòÖ I did my part and I'm very proud. But my team was just out of this world. 3 GCC Legends always rising to an higher prime version of themselves. I had a blast and enjoyed to the fullest the time spent with them and learned a lot.

## Performance üèÜü•á
**First win !** üéâü•≥ And won by a wide margin üöÄü§©
Of course this win is mostly deserved to my team than myself üòÖ I didn't do bad per say, but there is such an improvement to be made here. I could have cleared the OSINT (it could be easily done and I really did shit work but we'll come back to it later) and I could have done some better work for the Reverse and Forensic. Forensic is pure skill issue and I need *wayyyy* more training but for the Reverse I just didn't listened to myself. I knew dnsSpy would have obliterated the challenge but I was absolutely sure and was too lazy to download the required tool. Two BIG mistakes that separate a good CTF player from a bad one in my opinion. The fear or laziness of not trying.
As always, I need to work more üî®üë®‚Äçüîß But this time I enjoy the win and party ü•≥
**Fun note:** clutching an OSINT challenge 30 seconds before the end is so good üòéü§ô

Rank: ü•á with *10639 points* ü§ØüéâüöÄüî•

## How to improve üìù
### Steganography
- Ok maybe I need to push my knowledges further in file analysis but steganography... Maybe not today...
### Reverse
- I think I quite like *Game Hacking*. Maybe I'm influenced by my [gamedev background](https://shynif.itch.io) but I really like the concepts and challenges I'm facing.
- We need to work on Game Hacking challenges in Hack The Box so maybe it's a good time to start diving in the subject üëÄ
### OSINT
- Need to work on more traditional challenges => CVE, Malware, Process, IoCs, ...
- Do more complex challenges for RAM dumps and Disk analysis. Especially when challenges need to dive into processes, their files, how they work, how to retrieve intel from them, ...
### OSINT
- **HAVE YOU HEARD OF *MASTODON* GRANDPA ?!?!** üë¥
- I wrote back at [[üóÉCTF  details/2024/Breizh-CTF-2024\|Breizh CTF 2024]] to work on my SOCINT Methodology. And well looks like I'm getting worse with time. I completely F-ed up and I need to start relearning SOCINT from start at this point. If I can't find a simple Mastodon account, let's not talk about Matrix, VK, Telegram, ...
- I need to reconnect and grind ‚õèÔ∏è
