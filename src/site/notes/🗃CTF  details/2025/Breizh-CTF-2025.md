# Breizh 2025 🌊😋🌧️

> Big thanks to my team! We did great togethers 💖
> The chad list:
> - **Migatte No Chauvui**, our OSINT legend 🔍🕵️
> - **Cr0wbar_**, our Reverse and PWN mastermind ☄️
> - **Philippe Katerine**, our Web, Hardware expert and Bluetooth translator 📡🛰️
> - **Zlippy**, our Forensic inspector in charge 👮‍♂️
> Compared to my team's performance, mine is really poor. They all did fantastic and completely obliterated their challenges and I felt like I didn't do enough as fast I should to keep up with their pace and the general contest pace.

## Performance 🏆
Good ranking quite a long time but ended **18**th out of 120 teams just at the end. Really proud of our performance, we even got 2 *first blood* on real challenges 🩸 (please don't look at the Breizh CTF playlist, I didn't choose this 2 catastrophic first blood songs 😶‍🌫️)
We can be really proud of us. We were in what I call the "3rd bracket" of level.
- 4th bracket 0-5898 (120th-19th)
- 3rd bracket 6463-7110 (18th-7th)
- 2nd bracket 7297-7576 (6th-4th)
- 1st bracket 9088, 9438 and 11391 🤯 (3rd-1st)

Rank: *18th* with *6463 points* 🤯🎉
	full cleared the MISC challenges 🧩 with 1 first blood 🩸

## How to improve 📝
### MISC
- Speed, speed, speed. As always. Just need some more training.
### General
- I. DID. NOT. COOK. IN. *CRYPTO*. I tried but failed sooooo miserably on challenges even ChatGPT could solve... I will have to go back to the drawing board and train the basis very hard. Time for some Cryptohack babyyyy !
- It is something I'm trying recently but using AI to code faster and help in the solving process. It sounds bad but is actually a very good practice and is essential in fast paced like Breizh CTF was.

## Solves
didn't save the leaderboard in time :(
-  MISC : 5, full clear
- OSINT: 1
- WEB: 1
