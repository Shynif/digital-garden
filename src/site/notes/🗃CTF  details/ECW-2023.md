# European Cyber Week 2023 🇪🇺

## Performance 🏆
I worked hard the first and last week (I caught a huge cold on week 2 🥶💀) and managed **to qualify**. By solving almost all Easy challenges and one extra medium I managed to get qualified *dead last*. Also I'm not in the 48 first students I'm still qualified due to the limit of max 8 players being hit by ENSIBS students 🥵

Rank: *54th* with *775 points*
	with *10 challenges solved* 🥳

## How to improve 📝
### Reverse
- OMG how did I not know how to extract an array from binary 💀AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could have been 47th I could just do the easiest part of a chall. OMG OMG OMG 🧂 🧂 🧂
- 👆 So with a calm mind I can say I should definitely work more on my interactive reverse abilities and should definitely start using more tool. I tried BinaryNinja during this CTF but should have tried Ghidra (There are some SICK commands 😍).

### Crypto
- Work more on easy crypto challenges that are "wrong implementation"-like. There are some small details that I still miss (thinking about BMPaaS)

### General
- Mindset was ok-ish. First week was a great start with a nice lead in 8th but my moral was slightly eaten bit by bit afterwards. *Watch out for decreasing points*, it really added a layer of unnecessary stress. A constant fear of never having enough points and seeing eroding progress. Last week had a nice comeback and good grind mindset that got me qualified.
- Tinker a bit more, Jigsaw2 (4/4) was more doable than thought.
