# European Cyber Week 2023 🇪🇺

> If you read the previous version of this post you must have read that I got qualified.
> Sadly somehow didn't register correctly and wasn't on the leaderboard. I stepped down one rank and was kicked out of the leaderboard 😔
> That's life 🤷
> The most frustrating thing is that cheaters weren't banned but I'm just being salty 🧂 Flag hoarding people aren't fair but they still deserve to win (if they didn't steal the flag from a friend of course ☺️)
## Performance 🏆
I worked hard the first and last week (I caught a huge cold on week 2 🥶💀). By solving almost all Easy challenges and one extra medium I nearly managed to get qualified but sadly I'm *one off*.

Rank: *55th* with *775 points*
	with *10 challenges solved* 🥳

## How to improve 📝
### Reverse
- OMG how did I not know how to extract an array from binary 💀AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could have been 47th I could just do the easiest part of a chall. OMG OMG OMG 🧂 🧂 🧂
- 👆 So with a calm mind I can say I should definitely work more on my interactive reverse abilities and should definitely start using more tool. I tried BinaryNinja during this CTF but should have tried Ghidra (There are some SICK commands 😍).

### Crypto
- Work more on easy crypto challenges that are "wrong implementation"-like. There are some small details that I still miss (thinking about BMPaaS)

### General
- Mindset was ok-ish. First week was a great start with a nice lead in 8th but my moral was slightly eaten bit by bit afterwards. *Watch out for decreasing points*, it really added a layer of unnecessary stress. A constant fear of never having enough points and seeing eroding progress. Last week had a nice comeback and good grind mindset.
- Tinker a bit more, Jigsaw2 (4/4) was more doable than thought.
